# Regrowth Replant!
Staff of Regrowth automatically replant harvested herbs!

## Notes
- Does not support modded herbs (Idk how to do it).
- Staff of Regrowth will no longer break immature herbs in blocks that are not pot or platform, this is to prevent an issue of placing the seed and breaking it at the same time.

## Feel free to contribute!
This is my first mod of Terraria, so might have some odd things. If you have any idea how to implement support for modded herbs or fix some bugs, you can help this project if you want :)
